# .dotfiles

## Installation script

### Usage

It is recommended to only use this script if you have read the script and ***<u>FULLY</u>*** understand what it does. This script will (for the mean time) just create symlinks back to the .dotfiles locally cloned repo.

#### Args:

- `--replace-existing`: This will replace all existing directories with the files from this repo. Example: contents of .dotfiles/.config/i3 will replace ~/.config/i3/

## Config Setup

Make sure you have placed the configs in the correct places or use one of the installation scripts before proceeding with this section.
